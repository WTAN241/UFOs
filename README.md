# UFOs
## Overview of Project
Dana has build a webpage that provides users information on UFO sightings such as date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and a brief comment. This webpage also contains a dynamic table that allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Users will gain a more in-dept analysis by being able to filter for the city, state, country, and shape in the table.

## Results
This website provides the users a tool to narrow down their search and look for specific information more efficiently. The website's table includes 111 counts of data on UFO sightings. Instead of having the user look through all of the 111 rows of data, we have added the funcionalities of filtering the data according to date, city, country and shape. Once the user starts typing into either one of the four following blanks, the table will start filtering the data.

Instead of country, have the option to filter by state since the majority of entries are from the U.S. and there are only 2 entries for Canada.
