# UFOs
## Overview of Project
Dana has built a webpage that provides users information on UFO sightings such as date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and a brief comment. This webpage also contains a dynamic table that allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Users will gain a more in-dept analysis by being able to filter for the city, state, country, and shape in the table.

## Results
This website provides the users a tool to narrow down their search and look for specific information more efficiently. The website's table includes 111 counts of data on UFO sightings. Instead of having the user look through all of the 111 rows of data, we have added the funcionalities of filtering the data according to date, city, country and shape. First, the user starts to type into either one of the four following blanks as shown in the image below.

The table will start to automatically filter the data according to the first filter. 

![filters_1](https://github.com/WTAN241/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/filters_1.PNG)

As more filters are included, the data shown becomes narrower and provides the user with less options to look for. 

![filters_2](https://github.com/WTAN241/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/filters_2.PNG)

If the user wants to reset the filters and create brand-new filtering criterias, the user only has to refresh the webpage and the table with the entire dataset will show up.

## Summary
Although this webpage provides organized and detailed information of UFO sightings, a drawback of this webpage is that the data is limited to the North American region with the big majority in the U.S. Therefore, the insights that can be concluded from this data are limited due to the lack of diversity in countries.

The first recoommendation to improve this website is to use the filter of state instead of country. This is because the majority of entries are from the U.S. and there are only 2 entries for Canada. Another recommendation is to add a pop-up error message that warns when there is no data that matches the selected criteria so that the user can be aware of when the combination of filters used cannot filter the correct data.
